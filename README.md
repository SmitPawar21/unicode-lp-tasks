This project is made using React Js.

The task focuses on fetching data from the given API. This task has CRUD operations i.e. CREATE, READ, UPDATE and DELETE. 
1) CREATE: Creating a post - POST method is been used in this task to post all the data enterred by the user to create a new post. New window is opened so that user can enter the data in a user-friendly manner.
2) READ: displaying all posts - GET method is been used in this task to display all the data present in the given API.
3) UPDATE: editing posts - Every post has an edit button so that whenever user wants to edit the body of post, he may do that and after saving the edited data PUT method is been used in this task to update the post in API. The code is written in such a way that the card(post) will get edited if and only if the edit button is been clicked and after saving edited data we cannot edit the same and for that user has to click edit button again.
4) DELETE: deleting posts = Every post has delete button so that whenever user wants to delete the particular post, he may do that and that will be updated in API after calling DELETE method.

Axios is used for fetching the data in some of the parts. Also FETCH is used.
